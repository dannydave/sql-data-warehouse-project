| Layer      | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze** | Raw data ingested *as-is* from source CSV files into SQL Server. Acts as the single source of truth. |
| **Silver** | Cleansed and standardized data, ready for reliable querying and integration across datasets.         |
| **Gold**   | Business-ready, aggregated data modeled in a star schema optimized for analytics and reporting.      |
